//require imports the contents from the hello.js file 
//we create a variable hello to hold the contents of the file 
var hello = require('./hello');

//similar to how we access class methods in processing, we call the world function from our hello variable
//remember the hello variable holds all of the contents of our hello.js file 
hello.world();
